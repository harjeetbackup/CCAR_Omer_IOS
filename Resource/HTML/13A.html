My father once told me that a person is judged by three things. "First is a good name," he said. "Integrity and a good name are really all we have in life." He continued, "You must also have a sense of humor."<br/><br/>It's been quite a journey so far. Have compassion as I try to figure it out, and in the meantime, judge gently of me.
